Second CTP of version 0.4.0.

With this release, about 85% of 0.4.0 scope is completed.

Changes:
- improved following
- implemented attack
- implemented death / respawn / resurrection
- implemented dimensions
- updated starting map

Be sure to run csu and upgrade your storage before running the server.

The default server configuration has test commands disabled. To enable them,
change the configuration key to <enableTestCommands value="true"/>

In order to test player character death / dimensions, enable test commands and 
type the following command: #change_health -60

Now go and find the resurrecting NPC :-)

In order to test animal death / respawn, just attack an animal.
