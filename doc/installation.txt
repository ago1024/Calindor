Installation Instructions for Calindor

1. In order to run the server you need to have installed .NET Framework 2.0.
   It can be downloaded from:
   http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=0856EACB-4362-4B0D-8EDD-AAB15C5E04F5&displaylang=en

2. In order to connect to the server, you need Eternal Lands or compatible client
   software. The client needs to be configured with the correct IP and port. If 
   the server is running local and on default settings, you should be able to 
   connect to it using IP 127.0.0.1 and port 4242.

3. Default server configuration:
   IP = 0.0.0.0 (any local interface)
   Port = 4242
   Server Storage = ./storage
   Maps Path = ./maps

4. Installing maps
   
   The server is distributed WITHOUT maps. The server will start without them, but
   will not operate beyound starting point. At minimum you need one map, named
   the starting map.

4.1. Installing starting map
   
   The starting map is a minimal requirement for serwer to operate. You need to
   copy the map file (.elm, NOT .elm.gz) into "Maps Path" (see section 3). Then
   you need to configure the <startingMap> tag of coniguration:
   
   name - name of the map (without path)
   startX - start location X coordinate - must be walkable
   startY - start location Y coordinate - must be walkable

   If during server start, the map is found and start location is walkable, the
   server will run.

   This way you will be able to test your own maps live!

4.2. Installing predefined map set

   The server is preconfigured to use a set of original maps. If you would like to
   use them, copy the following maps (.elm, NOT .elm.gz) from client to 
   "Maps Path" (see section 3):
   
   cont2map5_insides.elm
   map2.elm
   map7_insides.elm
   misc1.elm
   startmap.elm
   startmap_insides.elm

   In order to use them, you don't have to change the <startingMap> configuration 
   key.   

5. Updating storage

   It is possible to update your existing storage to the new version of the server.
   This operation is done using Calindor Storage Updater (csu.exe). The application
   is located in the server's binaries directory.

   First, check if your previous version and current version of the server are
   supported. This is done by running csu.exe /supports. The application will
   list the names of supported server versions.

   If your versions are supported, run csu.exe /upgrade verFrom verTo, where verFrom
   is a version you want to upgrade from and verTo is the version you want to upgrade to.
   Be sure to use version names provided by /supports command.
