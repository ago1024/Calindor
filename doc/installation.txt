Installation Instructions for Calindor

1. In order to run the server you need to have installed

   On Windows: .NET Framework 2.0.
   It can be downloaded from:
   http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=0856EACB-4362-4B0D-8EDD-AAB15C5E04F5&displaylang=en

   On Linux: Mono 1.2.4
   Refer to you packaging system manager for mono packages.

2. In order to connect to the server, you need Eternal Lands or compatible client
   software. The client needs to be configured with the correct IP and port. If 
   the server is running local and on default settings, you should be able to 
   connect to it using IP 127.0.0.1 and port 4242.

2.1. For EL client older than 1.5.0.

   Change fields #server_address and #server_port in el.ini file.

2.2. For EL client 1.5.0 or newer.

   Add the following line to servers.lst file:

   calindor        calindor        127.0.0.1             4243    Calindor

   Then run the client by command line: el.exe calindor

3. Default server configuration:
   IP = 0.0.0.0 (any local interface)
   Port = 4242
   Server Storage = ./storage
   Maps Path = ./data/maps
   Test Commands = disabled

4. Installing maps

   The server requires maps to run. It will start without them, but will not operate 
   beyond starting point. At minimum you need one map, called the starting map.

   The server is distributed with a predefined starting map. This means that the 
   server is runnable 'out of the box'.

   Currently it is not possible to program map objects behaviour externally - the 
   behaviour is codded into the server.

4.1. Using predefined map

   The predefined map (calindor_startmap.elm) is located in "Maps Path" (see section 3).
   Before connecting to the server, you need to copy this map to your client's
   map directory.

4.2. Installing other map as starting map

   The starting map is a minimal requirement for serwer to operate. You need to
   copy the map file (.elm, NOT .elm.gz) into "Maps Path" (see section 3). Then
   you need to configure the <startingMap> tag of coniguration:

   name - name of the map (without path)
   startX - start location X coordinate - must be walkable
   startY - start location Y coordinate - must be walkable

   If during server start, the map is found and start location is walkable, the
   server will run.

   This way you will be able to test your own maps live!

5. Updating storage

   It is possible to update your existing storage to the new version of the server.
   This operation is done using Calindor Storage Updater (csu.exe). The application
   is located in the server's binaries directory.

   First, check if your previous version and current version of the server are
   supported. This is done by running 'csu.exe /supports'. The application will
   list the names of supported server versions.

   If your versions are supported, run 'csu.exe /upgrade verFrom verTo', where verFrom
   is a version you want to upgrade from and verTo is the version you want to upgrade to.
   Be sure to use version names provided by /supports command.
