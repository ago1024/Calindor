This document lists major functionalities that are either hacked 
or only basic implemented in order to continue on the development.
These functionalities need to be fully implemented eventually.

1. Server side scripting - scripts external to server code used for 
programming behaviour - for example: reaction to map object clicking,
reaction to NPC messages, quests

2. Pathfinding - current algorith is very simple and not efficient

3. Following - with current implementation it is very easy to break 
following. The algorithm should be update to avoid obstacles better.

4. AI - currenty the AI is pretty simple. More advance AI could be 
created since the framework is modular. Examples of desired AI: small
animals run if the see predators (players as well), predators attack
animals and players, predators group and attack (wolves?)

5. Visibility calculations - ther is a lot of list based operations with
current visibility model. Visibility is updated each cycle and it can
become the bootleneck because the CPU consumption is not linear. Possible
solution: make visibility update different for each entity but in such
way, that all entities would update within a short time span (250ms)

6. Create 'core' library - move the messaging/entities code ouf of the
server and put it into a library. The library then can be used by both
the server and the clients (bots? custom client?). The messaging codes
needs to become 'two way' (each message needs both serialization and
deserialization)
