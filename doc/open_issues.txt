This document lists major functionalities that are either hacked 
or only basic implemented in order to continue on the development.
These functionalities need to be fully implemented eventually.

1. Server side scripting - scripts external to server code used for 
programming behaviour - for example: reaction to map object clicking,
reaction to NPC messages, quests

2. Pathfinding - current algorith is very simple and not efficient

3. Following - with current implementation it is very easy to break 
following. The algorithm should be update to avoid obstacles better.
